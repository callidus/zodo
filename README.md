# zodo

A todo.txt TUI coded in Zig. This is an effort to learn the Zig programming language by creating a simple (but not too simple) program that could also be somewhat useful. I am probably doing a bunch of stuff wrong or "not the Zig way" so keep that in mind if you read over the code during your own Zig journey.
